# 👾 Back-End challenge - Graphql API
This is a quick coding challenge we designed to assess your qualifications as a potential back-end developer. It's important to note that this is by no means a test. We just want to get a sense of how you write code and solve problems.

## Getting started
To get started with this challenge: 
1) Fork this repository.
2) Create a branch with the name: ``yourlevel-yourname``, example: ``JR-jhondoe``

## The Challenge
We'll be looking for **simple, well-designed and tested(only PL/SR)** code in the submission.

Please include a ``INSTRUCTIONS.md``:
- Setup instructions
